# Collaborative-Filtering
Machine Learning project

Movie recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering & K-means clustering Algorithms. In this project we have using Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms was used in this project and Evaluation of K-means Clustering is available in this project.
Recommendation based on genre based customer ratings and first select the matching movie's id and that movie's id with both movie's table and user table. which movie's id is same we extract the user id for that particular movie's id and apply the that data 
into K-means clustering algorithm after we have make the groups based distance measures using euclidian distance and we find the K value of K-means using two methods one is elbow and another one is silhoutte method
find the best k after we make the groups. output of clustering data was applied with collaborative filtering method is apply and recommend the movies to specified user id also new users 
and also display the top 20 movie and ratings.
